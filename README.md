# Pokedex Web Application

So this Pokedex Web Application was actually one of the first web-apps that I built front to back and hosted online. It was a pivotal moment in my development as a fullstack developer and as a software engineer because there were so many things that I learned that stuck with me as I embarked on this multi-month project. This was the first time I ever built a frontend using typescript. I had also never built my own API from scratch or ever incorporated user authentication / account creation in a website before. Until now I didn't even really understand the client server model, or what it meant to have a website "hosted" somewhere, or what a web server really was. 
However, the biggest thing that I took away from this project was the power of consistency and how tackling a small subset of problems each day overtime leads to huge progress being made. I used to wake up every single day a couple hours before my work started and pick out one new thing that I wanted to learn or implement that day. Over the course of a couple of months, the project finally came together and I was able to host it. While there are definitely things that could be improved on, I'm pretty satisfied with the result(for now!)
