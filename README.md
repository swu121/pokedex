# Pokedex Web Application

So this Pokedex Web Application was actually one of the first web-apps that I built front to back and hosted online. It was a pivotal moment in my development as a fullstack developer and as a software engineer because there were so many things that I learned that stuck with me as I embarked on this multi-month project. This was the first time I ever built a frontend using typescript. I had also never built my own API from scratch or ever incorporated user authentication / account creation in a website before. Until now I didn't even really understand the client server model, or what it meant to have a website "hosted" somewhere, or what a web server really was. 
However, the biggest thing that I took away from this project was the power of consistency and how tackling a small subset of problems each day overtime leads to huge progress being made. I used to wake up every single day a couple hours before my work started and pick out one new thing that I wanted to learn or implement that day. Over the course of a couple of months, the project finally came together and I was able to host it. While there are definitely things that could be improved on, I'm pretty satisfied with the result(for now!)
One of my biggest regrets was not documenting day-by-day all the stuff that I learned. Sure, there would be a couple days where I'd be consistent and write stuff down as I went but as the project took more time to complete, I eventually got lazy with it. ![Screenshot_18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35361769/187552306-0877e7cd-e88d-4e67-9542-288c06e5716a.png) Good news is that although the website is pretty much done in terms of design and functionality, there is one more issue that I still have yet to tackle - its atrocious load time.
